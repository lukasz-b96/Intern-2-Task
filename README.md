# How to run: npm start

## Solution can be found in folder "components":

- I decided to split this task to three files
- It was not so necessary because problem was easy and not complicated

### The approach to the problem:

- This task can be resolved in multiple way: useReducer, Vanilla JavaScript etc.
- I just used HTML attributes to provide validations
- In e-mail input I sticked to the task and just validate\
  if string contains at least one "." and at most one "@"
- I decided to not overcomplicate it and just use useState and pass "handlers" in props
- Then, I created two reausable components
